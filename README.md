JIRA Duplicate Detection System

AI-powered bug report duplicate detection system using semantic search and hybrid matching.

--Primary Objective

Automatically surface similar existing reports when a new bug report is submitted

Minimize duplicate bug reports

Improve the productivity of development and QA/testing teams

 ##Real-Time Data Management

Hugging Face Spaces: Data is stored and updated in real time on Hugging Face Spaces

Cloud-Based Embeddings: Embedding generation runs in Hugging Face Spaces

Automatic Synchronization: Two-way automatic sync between local systems and the cloud

## Features

- **Semantic Search**: FAISS-based vector similarity search
- **Hybrid Matching**: Bi-encoder + Cross-encoder re-ranking
- **Multi-language Support**: Turkish + English
- **User-specific Data**: Each user manages their own data, which is securely stored in isolated environments within Hugging Face Spaces.
All user-specific embeddings, session histories, and vector representations are maintained in separate namespaces, ensuring complete data isolation and privacy.
- **Feature Extraction**: Automatically extract metadata from text
- **Real-time Embedding**: Dynamic embedding generation

- üì§ Data Management

Note: The current demo account is reserved for Turkcell QA engineers. If you‚Äôre not within Turkcell, please create a new account and upload your own dataset to begin.

üöÄ Alternative: Start with Your Own Account

Upload your data via CSV/Excel

##Getting Started with Your Own Data

Before uploading your CSV/Excel file, make sure to fill in column names that match your data (e.g., title, description, platform, version, etc.).

Once the upload is complete, embeddings are generated in real time.

Depending on dataset size, this may take a few minutes (typically ~5 min).

After processing finishes, you can start testing similarity searches.
